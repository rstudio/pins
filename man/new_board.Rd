\usage{
new_board(board, name, cache, versions = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{board}{The name of the board to register.}

\item{name}{An optional name used identify the board. This is no longer
generally needed since you should be passing around an explicit
board object.}

\item{cache}{Cache path. Every board requires a local cache to avoid
downloading files multiple times. The default stores in a standard
cache location for your operating system, but you can override if needed.}

\item{versions}{Should this board be registered with support for versions?}

\item{...}{Additional parameters required to initialize a particular board.}
