## Registering

In order to use GitHub as a [board](boards-understanding.html), you should first authenticate. If you are familiar with GitHub and is already part of your workflow, is likely that you'll have a `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable already configured. You can check if GitHub is already configured by running:

```{r eval=FALSE}
nchar(Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT")) > 0
```

If the above statement is `TRUE`, this means GitHub is already configured, which means you can register an existing GitHub board as follows. However, when using a new repo, first manually create an empty repo from [github.com/new](https://github.com/new).

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(pins)
board_register_github(repo = "owner/repo")
```

Usually, you will want to set `owner` to be your GitHub username or an organization name you belong to, learn more [About Repositories](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-repositories) in the GitHub docs.

Notice that `board_register_github()` is just an alias with named parameters to `board_register()`; the previous code is equivalent to:

```{r eval=FALSE}
board_register("github", repo = "owner/repo")
```

Alternatively, you can create a GitHub token at [github.com/settings/tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the required permissions to access your repo. For public repos, you only need the `public_repo` scope:

Once the token is created, you can register your GitHub board through:

```{r eval=FALSE}
board_register_github(repo = "owner/repo", token = "<new-token>")
```

This completes the board registration process, you can now focus on using and sharing pins in GitHub.


### Large Files

A GitHub repo only supports files under 25MB in size (100MB in theory but there is additional overhead when using the GitHub API). To store large files, GitHub [recommends](https://help.github.com/en/articles/distributing-large-binaries) storing them using GitHub Releases which support up to 2GB files.

Therefore, to support large files, `pins` makes use of GitHub release files. When you upload a file over , `pins` will create a new GitHub release file for that particular pin. Everything else works as expected, you can still retrieve the large resource with `pin_get()` and find it with `pin_find()`. The only noticeable change is new releases being created in your repo:

You can configure the 25MB check to use release files with the `pins.github.release` option.
