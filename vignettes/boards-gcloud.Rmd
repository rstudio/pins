## Registering

In order to use Google Cloud Storage as a [board](boards-understanding.html), you need a Google Cloud Storage account, a Google Storage bucket, and an access token or the [Gogole Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) properly installed and configured. You can sign-up and create those from [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com):

You can then use the Google Cloud Storage bucket and implicitly the Google Cloud SDK (or an explicit token) to authenticate:

```{r eval=FALSE}
board_register_gcloud(bucket = "pinscontainer")
```

It is recommend to install the Google Cloud SDK to avoid managing access tokens; however, you can also retrieve an Access Token from [developers.google.com/oauthplayground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground). This approach requires you to authorize the "Google Storage API v1" scope.
