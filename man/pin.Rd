\usage{
pin(x, name = NULL, description = NULL, board = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object, local file or remote URL to pin.}

\item{name}{The name for the dataset or object.}

\item{description}{Optional description for this pin.}

\item{board}{The board where this pin will be placed.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters.}
}
\description{
Pins the given resource locally or to the given board.
}
\details{
\code{pin()} allows you to cache remote resources and intermediate results with ease. When
caching remote resources, usually URLs, it will check for HTTP caching headers to avoid
re-downloading when the remote result has not changed.

This makes it ideal to support reproducible research by requiring manual instruction to
download resources before running your R script.

In addition, \code{pin()} still works when working offline or when the remote resource
becomes unavailable; when this happens, a warning will be triggered but your code will
continue to work.

\code{pin()} will stores data frames in two files, an R native file and a 'CSV' file. To
force saving a pin only using R's native (RDS) format, you can use \code{pin(I(data))}.
This can improve performance and size at the cost of making the pin unreadable from other
tools and programming languages.

\examples{
# define temporary local board
board <- board_local(cache = tempfile())

# cache the mtcars dataset
pin(mtcars, board = board)

# cache computation over mtcars
pin(mtcars[mtcars$mpg > 30, ], name = "mtefficient", board = board)

# retrieve cached pin
pin_get("mtefficient", board = board)

# url to remote resource
resource <- file.path(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/prophet",
  "master/examples/example_retail_sales.csv"
)

# cache remote resource
pin(resource, name = "example_retail_sales", board = board)

# cache and read csv
path <- pin(resource, board = board)
path
head(read.csv(path))
}
