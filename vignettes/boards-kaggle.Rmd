```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
library(pins)
```

## Registering

In order to use Kaggle as a [board](boards-understanding.html), you need to authenticate first by creating a token file from [kaggle.com/me/account](https://www.kaggle.com/me/account). 

```{r eval=FALSE}
board_register_kaggle(token = "path/to/kaggle.json")
```

Notice that `board_register_kaggle()` is just an alias with named parameters to `board_register()`; the previous code is equivalent to:

```{r eval=FALSE}
board_register("kaggle", token = "path/to/kaggle.json")
```

Once the board is registered, you can pin and search using `pin()`, `pin_get()` and `pin_find()`.

### Competitions

Datasets are also searched within competitions and are referenced by the `c/` prefix. For instance, when searching for `crowdflower` notice the `c/crowdflower-weather-twitter` entry:

```r
pin_find("crowdflower", board = "kaggle")
```
```

```

You can then download the data associated to the `c/crowdflower-weather-twitter` competition:

```r
pin_get("c/crowdflower-weather-twitter", board = "kaggle")
```
```

[2] "/Users/javierluraschi/Library/Caches/pins/kaggle/crowdflower-weather-twitter/test.csv"            
[3] "/Users/javierluraschi/Library/Caches/pins/kaggle/crowdflower-weather-twitter/train.csv"

```

## Sharing

When working in teams, you might want to share your pins with others. For Kaggle boards, this is accomplished by adding users or making the dataset public through Kaggle's website.

Once you share with specific users, they can follow the same steps to register a Kaggle board which allows them to download pins shared with them or upload their own pins.
