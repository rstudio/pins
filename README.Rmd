## Overview

You can use the `pins` package to:

- **Pin** remote resources locally.
- **Discover** new resources across different boards.
- **Share** resources in local folders, with RStudio Connect, on S3, and more.

## Installation 

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install the released version from CRAN:
install.packages("pins")
```

## Usage

To begin using the pins package, you must create a board. A good place to start is the local board, which stores pins in a local directory. Here I use a temporary board, so that you can run these examples without messing up the other data you might have pinned:

```{r setup}
library(pins)

b <- board_local(tempfile())
b
```

Next you need to store some data in that board with `pin_write()`:

```{r}
b %>% pin_write(mtcars)
b
```

Later, you can retrieve that data with `pin_read()`:

```{r}
b %>% pin_read("mtcars")
```

This can be convenient when working locally, but the real power of pins comes when you use a shared board, because because the writer and reader can be different people (or automated processes).

For example, if you use RStudio Connect, you can pin data to shared board:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
b <- board_rsconnect()
b %>% pin_write(tidy_sales_data, "sales-summary")
#> Saving to hadley/sales-summary
```

And then someone else (or an automated Rmd report) can read it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
b <- board_rsconnect()
b %>% pin_read("hadley/sales-summary")
```

You can easily control who gets to see it using the RStudio Connection permissions pane.

As well as RStudio connect, you can share your pins:

* In shared folders: `board_local()`.
* On GitHub: `board_github()`.
* In Microsoft Azure's storage: `board_azure()`.
* On Amazon's S3: `board_s3()`.
