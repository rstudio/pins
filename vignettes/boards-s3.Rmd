## Registering

In order to use Amazon S3 Storage as a [board](boards-understanding.html), you need an Amazon S3 bucket and a user key enabled for programmatic access container created with enough permissions to access the S3 bucket. You can sign-up and create those from [amazonaws.com](https://aws.amazon.com/). Please notice that after crating a bucket, it can take several minutes for this bucket to be usable.

You can then use the S3 Storage bucket, key, and secret to authenticate:

```{r eval=FALSE}
board_register_s3(bucket = "pinsbucket",
                  key = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
                  secret = "ABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCA==")
```

It is highly recommended to specify the region when registering a board. Since this enables `pins` to use the V4 signature which is now required in some AWS regions:

```{r eval=FALSE}
board_register("s3", bucket = "pinsbucket",
                     key = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
                     secret = "ABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCA==",
                     region = "us-west-2")
```

Once the board is registered, you can pin and search using `pin()`, `pin_get()` and `pin_find()`.
